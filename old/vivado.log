Changes in your design (including the PCW configuration settings) are not automatically exported from Vivado to Xilinx's SDK, Petalinux or Yocto.
This is by design to avoid disrupting existing embedded development efforts. To have any changes of your design taking effect in the embedded software flow please export your
design by going through Vivado's main menu, click on File, then Export finally select Export Hardware, please ensure you click on the Include BitStream option.
The auto-generated HDF file is all you need to import in Xilinx's SDK, Petalinux or Yocto for your changes to be reflected in the Embedded Software Flow.

INFO: [Vivado-projutils-15] Please note that by default, the file path for the project source files were set wth respect to the 'origin_dir' variable in the
 generated script. When this script is executed from the output directory, these source files will be referenced with respect to this 'origin_dir' path value.
 In case this script was later moved to a different directory, the 'origin_dir' value must be set manually in the script with the path
 relative to the new output directory to make sure that the source files are referenced correctly from the original project. You can also set the
 'origin_dir' automatically by setting the 'origin_dir_loc' variable in the tcl shell before sourcing this generated script. The 'origin_dir_loc'
 variable should be set to the path relative to the new output directory. Alternatively, if you are sourcing the script from the Vivado command line,
 then set the origin dir using '-tclargs --origin_dir <path>'. For example, 'vivado -mode tcl -source project_1.tcl -tclargs --origin_dir ".."

WARNING: [Vivado-projutils-10] Found source(s) that were local or imported into the project. If this project is being source controlled, then
 please ensure that the project source(s) are also part of this source controlled data. The list of these local source(s) can be found in the generated script
